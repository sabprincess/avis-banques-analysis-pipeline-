It cost me 80 euros per call and despite that nothing is not done!! Then I moved to Morocco in Meknes I asked them for the code and they told me you received it 🤦 even though I received nothing!! Blocked no transaction was made on my part from France to buy a property in Morocco because of their service until I broke down and I requested an account closure on the spot he asked me to write a letter I wrote it on the spot after I was received by the manager... she told me your letter is useless! Garbage can !! Ok thank you I would like to know why you asked me to write a letter 30 minutes ago => no response from her..and at the end she tells me the balance before withdrawing it to close except that she has tells me a false figure (100 DH less) and I catch up on the figure. since 2004 I have been with them after 20 years not even a question \"why do you want to close the account\" the customer is shit for them. They made me feel bad"

We went to see the manager who told us it's not his responsibility!!! We had to wait for the Casablanca headquarters to give their agreement. It was supposedly 3 days. To date it has been 3 weeks we have not been reimbursed. We were told to leave the Rib from my account in Morocco so that they would pay us our money. However, the manager asked us a few days ago that the best thing is to open an account with them so that they can pay us our money!!! But how can you not get angry with these people!!! Who do they take us for? We are nationals. We love our country. And that's why we come for 3 to 4 weeks of vacation. There is something to disgust you! It is unacceptable to treat us like this. I hope that my message will end up in the hands of higher officials so that our situation can be resolved quickly! We left our Rib on two occasions. THANKS. A word to the wise."

First I was questioned about the signature i do not mind but the way they asked that ticked me off. then t the representative pulled money out of her purse to complete the amount i was getting. Then there is a charge of pulling money from your account  using a check in a different branch. so I was ok with the fee but when I asked for a receipt for the fee they refuse to provide one  and the refusal was from  rep and the branch manager."

        "commentaire": "The Moroccan Bank for Commerce and Industry (BMCI) is one of the most widely used financial institutions currently in Morocco because of the quality of its services and banking products offered as well as its approach to its customers, whether direct or remotely.\n\nBMCI was actually created in 1943 but in order to have a close financial relationship between France and Morocco, the BNP Paribas Group which is a public limited company had taken it among its subsidiaries in 1964. The network being integrated into the euro zone and which currently covers more than 80 countries internationally. This had obtained through the BNP several partners throughout the world, apart from the BMCE Bank which is already established in Morocco as well as the Attijariwafa bank, the Casablanca Stock Exchange and the Banque Populaire du Maroc, we can cite a few placed in certain regions: in Burkina Faso, in Algeria, in the Comoros, in Benin in Cameroon, in Cape Verde, in China, in Gabon, in the Congo in Madagascar, in Brazil, in Togo, Cambodia, Turkey, Mauritius, Guinea, Sri Lanka, and Haiti…\n\nThe important strengths which motivated customers to be interested in opening an account with it are mainly because of its fairly reasonable prices compared to other organizations, opening an account is very easy and almost free of charge; by the diversification of the ranges of credits granted, many people are pushed to integrate into it.\n\nIts speed in transactions is widely recognized; its attractive interest and foreign exchange rates are encouraging. Its collaboration with Western Union and other entities by acting as an intermediary in the money transfer system from inside to outside or vice versa, provides it with many advantages both in its relationships with customers and in its own turnover obtained by the commissions received.\n\nRegarding the financial results, BMCI was able to bring out an increase of 4.5% in products in 2014 compared to those of 2013 despite the drop in the BNP Group's results of 33%. On the other hand, the operating coefficient of the said is 48% which still places it among the best Moroccan banks.\n\nThe future outlook for BMCI is flourishing in all discount and credit banking operations."

CFG Bank is located directly next door to another large bank, BMCI, at the Place du Koweit (\"Iberia\"), and also next to La Gelateria, a popular upscale cafe and restaurant. Formerly the location was a pleasant Italian restaurant called Luigi's. The large mosque Mohammed V is directly across the street.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the designer/architect felt it necessary to partially remove the upper stone exterior since it was part of the apartment building’s original structure and destroys the building architect's design. It should not have been allowed.\n\nThat said, this bank is fairly attractive inside, though sparce and very quiet. There is a separate ATM machine outside and another one inside. I had thought about opening an account at the CFG Bank, but after an inquiry I was told by an employee that I must be a resident of Morocco.\n\nI do have an account at a BMCI Bank and residency was not required, only my passport was necessary. CFG Bank is based in Casablanca, and as far as I know, it is the only CFG Bank in Tangier."

Not forgetting an overdraft request for 2000dh which has been 1 month now since I got any response!! Without forgetting that I deposited my salary direct debit in February with them to reduce the monthly fees to 33dh and until now I have been billed for two months at 66dh! Sincerely I regret having set foot in this bank at the beginning it fascinates you with the advanced equipment but then you discover that it is a fairly materialistic bank, they need customers with millions that's why their agencies are in strategic locations."

It is always a pleasure to do business with her and I am delighted to receive such excellent customer service.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this professional bank to anyone looking for quality banking services and attentive, knowledgeable staff.

Not available, ZERO customer service and above all an advisor (Myriam R) who looks down on you, unprofessional and never available. She's the worst advisor I've had since opening my first bank account!!!!\nIn my opinion, I think she chose the wrong profession. I don't know what she can do in her life but one thing is sure not to be a bank advisor.\n\nIf I could give this agency zero stars, I would!!!"

However, they required that this request be written on letterhead, which seems unnecessary and unjustified to me in this specific case.\n\nI had to wait a very long time for a service that was nevertheless simple. The staff was unwelcoming and unprofessional. My problem was only taken seriously after the intervention of an influential lady in the field, which is unfortunate for an ordinary customer.\n\nAs a customer, I expected more serious, rapid and respectful treatment.\nThis experience left me with a very negative impression, and I am now considering other banking options if improvements are not made.\n\nI hope that the bank will take concrete measures to strengthen the quality of its services and better meet the expectations of its customers in the future."

Please respect customers and provide service at the same level. It is unreasonable that providing a service that normally takes 10 minutes of your time while you manage it.

Restricted branch availability can effectively hamper customer convenience, making it difficult to access banking services.\n\nAdditionally, the poor quality of service provided is a serious concern. Ineffective banking service can have a significant impact on customer satisfaction and trust in the financial institution. It is important that banks constantly strive to improve their services to meet the needs of their customers, even in geographically restricted areas.\n\nIt may be helpful to express these concerns constructively by providing specific details of negative experiences so that the bank can take corrective action. Additionally, it might be a good idea to explore other banking options available in the area that might offer more satisfactory service."

I called three times, I visited the agency several times, but no one is taking the situation seriously. I even asked to speak to a customer service representative, who promised me a call back the next day… but no news since!\n\nFaced with this incompetence, I filed a complaint with Bank Al-Maghrib, accompanied by a request for compensation. If necessary, I will take this matter to court to assert my rights. It is time for this bank to understand that we are no longer in the Morocco of the 60s and that customers are not at their mercy. Such negligence is unacceptable! I strongly advise against this bank!"

Blocked no transaction was made on my part from France to buy a property in Morocco because of their service until I broke down and I requested an account closure on the spot he asked me to write a letter I wrote it on the spot after I was received by the manager... she told me your letter is useless! Garbage can !! Ok thank you I would like to know why you asked me to write a letter 30 minutes ago => no response from her..and at the end she tells me the balance before withdrawing it to close except that she has tells me a false figure (100 DH less) and I catch up on the figure. since 2004 I have been with them after 20 years not even a question \"why do you want to close the account\" the customer is shit for them.

We went to see the manager who told us it's not his responsibility!!! We had to wait for the Casablanca headquarters to give their agreement. It was supposedly 3 days. To date it has been 3 weeks we have not been reimbursed. We were told to leave the Rib from my account in Morocco so that they would pay us our money. However, the manager asked us a few days ago that the best thing is to open an account with them so that they can pay us our money!!! But how can you not get angry with these people!!! Who do they take us for? We are nationals. We love our country. And that's why we come for 3 to 4 weeks of vacation. There is something to disgust you! It is unacceptable to treat us like this. I hope that my message will end up in the hands of higher officials so that our situation can be resolved quickly! We left our Rib on two occasions. THANKS. A word to the wise."

Nothing, nada, walou, the staff didn't even deign to listen to me (wouldn't -just to listen to me), ignoring me to the point of contempt.\n\nIn short, more and more disappointed with the bank and their services, which are not worthy of a bank that claims to have a certain standing."

First I was questioned about the signature i do not mind but the way they asked that ticked me off. then t the representative pulled money out of her purse to complete the amount i was getting. Then there is a charge of pulling money from your account  using a check in a different branch. so I was ok with the fee but when I asked for a receipt for the fee they refuse to provide one  and the refusal was from  rep and the branch manager."

I don't know what address my statements go to, this is unacceptable and incomprehensible for a bank!!!!!

        "commentaire": "The Moroccan Bank for Commerce and Industry (BMCI) is one of the most widely used financial institutions currently in Morocco because of the quality of its services and banking products offered as well as its approach to its customers, whether direct or remotely.\n\nBMCI was actually created in 1943 but in order to have a close financial relationship between France and Morocco, the BNP Paribas Group which is a public limited company had taken it among its subsidiaries in 1964. The network being integrated into the euro zone and which currently covers more than 80 countries internationally. This had obtained through the BNP several partners throughout the world, apart from the BMCE Bank which is already established in Morocco as well as the Attijariwafa bank, the Casablanca Stock Exchange and the Banque Populaire du Maroc, we can cite a few placed in certain regions: in Burkina Faso, in Algeria, in the Comoros, in Benin in Cameroon, in Cape Verde, in China, in Gabon, in the Congo in Madagascar, in Brazil, in Togo, Cambodia, Turkey, Mauritius, Guinea, Sri Lanka, and Haiti…\n\nThe important strengths which motivated customers to be interested in opening an account with it are mainly because of its fairly reasonable prices compared to other organizations, opening an account is very easy and almost free of charge; by the diversification of the ranges of credits granted, many people are pushed to integrate into it.\n\nIts speed in transactions is widely recognized; its attractive interest and foreign exchange rates are encouraging. Its collaboration with Western Union and other entities by acting as an intermediary in the money transfer system from inside to outside or vice versa, provides it with many advantages both in its relationships with customers and in its own turnover obtained by the commissions received.\n\nRegarding the financial results, BMCI was able to bring out an increase of 4.5% in products in 2014 compared to those of 2013 despite the drop in the BNP Group's results of 33%. On the other hand, the operating coefficient of the said is 48% which still places it among the best Moroccan banks.\n\nThe future outlook for BMCI is flourishing in all discount and credit banking operations."

CFG Bank is located directly next door to another large bank, BMCI, at the Place du Koweit (\"Iberia\"), and also next to La Gelateria, a popular upscale cafe and restaurant. Formerly the location was a pleasant Italian restaurant called Luigi's. The large mosque Mohammed V is directly across the street.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the designer/architect felt it necessary to partially remove the upper stone exterior since it was part of the apartment building’s original structure and destroys the building architect's design. It should not have been allowed.\n\nThat said, this bank is fairly attractive inside, though sparce and very quiet. There is a separate ATM machine outside and another one inside. I had thought about opening an account at the CFG Bank, but after an inquiry I was told by an employee that I must be a resident of Morocco.\n\nI do have an account at a BMCI Bank and residency was not required, only my passport was necessary. CFG Bank is based in Casablanca, and as far as I know, it is the only CFG Bank in Tangier."

I signed up as a client, they treated me like a princess! Every time I call their call center, they respond quickly... they even call you back if they miss your call, which is unusual for banks here. The staff are incredibly humble and friendly. I hope they open more offices across the city and country. I think their monthly charge is not expensive in comparison to what they're delivering. You want ra7t lbal you pay for it!"

It takes 66dh per month from you for a pretty lousy service! 4 times my bank card has been swallowed by the counters because of their rotten systems! Each time they tell me that the problem will be resolved within 24 hours and always the same problem! Not forgetting an overdraft request for 2000dh which has been 1 month now since I got any response!! Without forgetting that I deposited my salary direct debit in February with them to reduce the monthly fees to 33dh and until now I have been billed for two months at 66dh! Sincerely I regret having set foot in this bank at the beginning it fascinates you with the advanced equipment but then you discover that it is a fairly materialistic bank, they need customers with millions that's why their agencies are in strategic locations."

The manager is not there, even he is in charge, only one employee does the work of 2 employees. This is unreasonable, and until now I have filed a report with this bank. System Zero, especially in this period of Corona, customer numbers are not organized. Sometimes the employee receives a phone call in order to serve a customer at the end of the line... Please respect customers and provide service at the same level. It is unreasonable that providing a service that normally takes 10 minutes of your time while you manage it. In one hour. 5 minutes of service, 55 minutes of gossip and talk..."

        "commentaire": "It is unfortunate to note that the bank in question has service gaps, particularly due to its limited number of branches (only one branch) in a small town. Restricted branch availability can effectively hamper customer convenience, making it difficult to access banking services.\n\nAdditionally, the poor quality of service provided is a serious concern. Ineffective banking service can have a significant impact on customer satisfaction and trust in the financial institution. It is important that banks constantly strive to improve their services to meet the needs of their customers, even in geographically restricted areas.\n\nIt may be helpful to express these concerns constructively by providing specific details of negative experiences so that the bank can take corrective action. Additionally, it might be a good idea to explore other banking options available in the area that might offer more satisfactory service."

The only people who are ashamed of all the chaos in the banks are the security guards; only on their faces can you see the reflection and understanding of the disgustingness of the situation.

Je me suis assis seul pendant quinze minutes!  dans la banque, jusqu'à ce que je demande à l'employé le plus proche de la sortie ce qui se passait, il me répondit: Tu parles anglais, moi non, attends (réponse en anglais!!!).  J'ai attendu encore 5 minutes et je suis parti.  C'est dans une banque internationale.  Les seules personnes qui ont honte de toute l'anarchie dans les banques sont les gardes, ce n'est que sur leurs visages que vous pouvez voir le reflet et la compréhension de la situation dégoûtante."
